Canary is the service providing public status and information for
link:http://codevalet.io[Code Valet].

== Goals

. Provide live-visibility for link:https://jenkins.io[Jenkins] developers into
  warnings/errors from Code Valet.
. Give Code Valet users insight into the status of the service.
. Provide Code Valet administrators with a centralized dashboard for service
  health.



== Hacking

This application requires a Sentry API token to be defined in the environment
as `SENTRY_API_TOKEN` or else it simply won't work properly.

Once that environment variable has been defined, executing `make run` on a
Docker-capable machine should bring Canary online at
link:http://localhost:9292/[localhost:9292].
